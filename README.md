# Gift Campaign app

This is my demo REST API project I created in two weeks for a position I applied.

It is hosted at: https://youthful-villani-9e241f.netlify.app/

## Description

This is a storage and distribution management system for corporate gifts. It is used to create items and track their count in storage, create gift
boxes, send them and get feedback from recipients.

There are two user roles:
- Human resources:
  - Can create gift items and gift boxes
  - Can send gifts to employees
  - Can view history and get feedback from employees
- Employee:
  - Can receive gifts and view their contents
  - Can rate gifts

### Technologies

- Client side:
  - React
  - Redux
  - Material UI
- Server side:
  - Node.js
  - Express
  - MySQL
  - Socket.io

### How to test

To test the application visit https://youthful-villani-9e241f.netlify.app/. Create at least 1 Human resources and a couple of Employee accounts. Create, send and rate gifts to see how application works.

Please contact me for database connection values if you want to test the application on your local machine.
